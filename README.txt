Project goal: Help you practice staying on tempo.

You can add songs, record practice runs of those songs, and see how you did over time.

I use an audio processing library called TarsosDSP to help me find the bp of the audio. I had to hack the source code and download some audio decoding binaries to get it to run. (Part of the huge file size).
I also use a graphing library to help me display data to the user (MPAndroidCharts).

Near the deadline, I wanted to add features, but it got way out of hand and took a lot longer than expected.
